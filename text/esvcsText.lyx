Pay for the option to pay?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The scientific information to precisely link land use changes to changes
 in ecosystem service provision is often unavailable, particularly for hydrologi
cal ecosystem services.
 Potential buyers of ecosystem services must weigh the risk of paying to
 incentive conservation that fails to deliver valuable ecosystem services
 against the risk that land is developed before its value is known.
 This paper uses a two period model to assess when expected future improvements
 in scientific information should substantially impact payments for conservation
 today.
 Optimal current payments increase, often substantially, as the quality
 of expected future information increases, but the gain from increasing
 payments to account for the expected degree of improved information is
 small in many cases.
 Larger values occur when the buyer believes that the land whose private
 development value is the highest also provides the highest ecosystem service,
 when the buyer faces relatively more uncertainty about ecosystem service
 provision than about the cost of inducing conservation, and when the buyer
 believes land is highly likely to be developed absent incentive payments.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
There is a growing recognition that undeveloped land provides many ecosystem
 services.
 When the benefits of these service are external to private landowners,
 private land use decisions are not optimal.
 In this setting, using a payment for ecosystem services (PES) plan to promote
 conservation represents a potentially important policy tool

 services as as one of the four critical factors for identifying whether
 PES programs can provide benefit.
 In particular, the relationship between ecosystem service provision and
 land-use is often imprecisely understood so that ecologists are rarely
 able to provide specific estimates of the service provided by individual
 parcels.
 Moreover, even when the biophysical services can be accurately quantified,
 the economic value of those services is also uncertain

 As a result, buyers seeking to implement payment for ecosystem service

 If potential ES buyers wait until they are sure of the services provided
 by a parcel, it may be too late to avoid development.
 Instead, buyers may need to provide conservation incentives today to preserve
 the option to pay for valuable ecosystem services tomorrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, I use a two period model to investigate how expected improvements
 in knowledge about the link between land use changes and ecosystem service
 (ES) provision affect optimal payments today.
 A buyer of ES can offer payment to a landowner today in exchange for an
 agreement to conserve land for a specified period of time but faces uncertainty
 about both the payment needed to induce conservation and the ecosystem
 services provided by the parcel.
 The buyer weighs the risk of paying for conservation on parcels that in
 fact provide little to no ES value against the risk that land that does
 have high ES value will be irreversibly developed before the buyer learns
 this.
 I begin by considering the optimal offer the buyer should make once improved
 information is available.
 I then step back in time and ask how landowners should respond in the prior
 period, knowing that if they do not develop their land, buyers will learn
 more information about conservation value and make more specific offers
 in the future.
 I find that under most conditions, the possibility of improved future informati
on does not influence a landowner's choice in the first period.
 Finally, I step back further and explore what offer a buyer should make
 today, given the possibility of improved information in the future.
 The improved information naturally leads to increased offers today and
 increases the range of parameters for which making positive offers is optimal.
 At the same time, the increase in the buyer's payoff from responding optimally
 tends to be quite small unless the land is highly likely to be developed
 in the absence of a payment today

 In their model, the buyer faces uncertainty about whether a particular

 Since the uncertainty cannot be resolved before the buyer either commits
 to payment or loses the opportunity for conservation, there is no gain
 from waiting for better information.

 consider the dynamic effect of purchasing land over time on equilibrium

 My analysis differs from the reserve site selection literature in two important
 ways.
 First, the emphasis in the site selection literature is on uncertainty
 over which sites will be developed.
 I couple this uncertainty with partially reducible uncertainty about the
 benefits different sites provide.
 Second, I focus on temporary payments for delaying conservation rather
 than permanent payments.

 payments need to induce landowners to conserve their land when landowners
 face uncertainty about the future (private) benefits from both conservation

 They compute the minimum payments needed to induce conservation but do
 no optimize from the buyer's perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ES buyer in this paper faces uncertainty about both the cost of inducing
 conservation and the benefits of conservation.
 Both sources of uncertainty have been considered previously.
 Buyer uncertainty about the payment need to induce conservation is a result
 of asymmetric information between the landowner and buyer.

 describe three types of inefficiency that can plague PES programs as a
 result of this asymmetry: failing to provide a sufficiently high incentive
 when conservation would be valuable, paying more conservation than it is
 worth, and paying for non-additional conservation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ferraro2008asymmetric"

\end_inset

 notes that strategies to reduce the cost of asymmetric information on PES
 programs generally fall into three categories: (1) acquiring more information,
 (2) offering a menu of contracts using techniques from the mechanism design
 literature, or (3) conducting procurement auctions.
 While the literature has often focused on the second

 approaches, Ferraro emphasizes that no one approach dominates.
 Moreover, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "arnold2013adverse"

\end_inset

 emphasize that adverse selection remains an issue with auctions.
 The buyer in the present analysis implicitly adopts the first strategy,
 allowing buyers to condition a single take-it-or-leave it offer on only
 observed information.
 The emphasis here is on learning more information about the conservation
 value of a parcel of land; knowledge about the private development is gained
 only indirectly when correlation between values is present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uncertainty about the ES provided by land use practices has also received
 considerable attention in the literature.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rabotyagov2010ecosystem"

\end_inset

 considers a regulator or purchaser of offsets who wishes to maximize the
 benefit of services subject to a constraint on the likelihood that a level
 of service greater than or equal to the claimed level is actually provided
 and demonstrates that applying a margin of safety discount is optimal for
 a regulator or aggregator whose preferences exhibit constant absolute risk
 aversion.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "springborn2013crediting"

\end_inset

 argue that margin of safety discounts should generally be applied at a
 high level of aggregation rather than at a parcel level.
 An important consideration in the literature considering mechanisms to
 reduce the cost of asymmetric information is the relative performance of
 input based payments versus output based payments when buyers are risk
 neutral and landowners are risk-averse but landowners have better information
 on the services provided by their parcel than buyers do 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The buyer's level of uncertainty remains fixed in these analyses; in contrast,
 I consider how reductions in uncertainty could affect payments in a multi-perio
d setting.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
 Section 2 of the paper develops the multi-period analytical model and provides
 a preliminary discussion of the impacts of model parameters.
 Since the model does not have an analytical solution, Sections 3 and 4
 use numerical simulations to describe these impacts, with section 3 assuming
 independence between the uncertainty in public conservation value and private
 development value and section 4 considering the impact of correlation.
 Section 5 offers concluding comments.

Consider a parcel of land that has two possible states (developed and conserved)
 and assume that the decision to develop a parcel of land is irreversible.
 While the value of conserved land may in general depend on the state of
 neighboring parcels, the model here focuses on the decision about a single
 parcel and thus assumes that either the state of neighboring parcels is
 known and fixed or that the value of this particular parcel is independent
 of the state of neighboring parcels.
 Consider a buyer who wishes to maximize the value of services generated
 by the parcel over two time periods.

 Instead of explicitly modeling the components of private benefits, I let

 represent the private net benefit of development over conservation.
 Similarly, the buyer could derive benefits from land in either state.
 I define the buyer's net benefit of

 This benefit considers all possible benefits that the parcel provides

I assume that the buyer views payments as costs rather than redistributive
 transfers.
 This is consistent with a buyer representing direct beneficiaries of ecosystem
 services (e.g.
 a downstream water utility making payments to upstream landowners).
 To the extent that the buyer represents a government who views the payments
 as transfers, the cost of payments in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) could be multiplied by a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 representing the opportunity cost of funds to pay for the transfers.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, the buyer has imperfect information about the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

.
 In particular, in the first period, the buyer has little information about
 how much, if anything, the parcel needs to be paid to remain undeveloped
 or the actual benefit the parcel provides if conserved.
 Waiting for additional information that is expected to arrive in the future
 carries a substantial risk that the land will be irreversibly developed
 before its conservation value is known.
 The possibility of new information creates an option value of conservation
 that will increase the buyer's willingness to pay for conservation today.
 The goal of the model is to describe how this option value influences both
 offers and social welfare today.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To focus on this possibility, I assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

 is fixed over time.
 At time 0, the buyer has an initial estimate of the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

.
 At time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, the buyer observes a signal 
\begin_inset Formula $\se$
\end_inset

 that reduces uncertainty about the true conservation value.
 For analytical tractability, I assume that the variables have a multivariate
 normal distribution with the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\se\\
\priv\\
\env
\end{array}\right]\sim N_{3}\left(\left[\begin{array}{c}

With this structure 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\env\se}\in\left(0,1\right)$

 measures the correlation between environmental service value and private

 Such payments are outside the typical scope of payment for ecosystem service
 plans and are not considered in this analysis.

\end_inset

 Although the buyer does not receive a direct signal about the value of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$

 In particular, under conditions described below, the buyer infers that
 there is an upper bound

 Since this is the last period, the landowner will accept the offer if

 The buyer's goal is to maximize the expected value from conservation less
 any payments made to the landowner.
 An offer greater than

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\regPay\left(\offer,\se\right)=\intop_{-\infty}^{\offer}\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\env-\offer\right)f_{\env|\se,\priv}\left(\env|\se,\priv\right)d\env f_{\priv|\se}\left(\priv|\se\right)dp\label{eq:finalPeriodObjFunc}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since this expression is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv$
\end_inset

, the upper bound affects the problem only through the constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer\leq\ubPriv$
\end_inset

.
 As shown in the appendix, under the multivariate normal assumption, this
 expression can be simplified to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\regPay\left(\offer,\se\right)=-\sigma_{\env}\sigma_{\priv}\bVal f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)+\left(\meanE+\rho_{\env\se}\sigma_{\env}\se-\offer\right)F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The buyer's goal is to identify the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer\in\left[0,\ubPriv\right]$
\end_inset

 that maximizes this expression.

 The right hand side is the marginal cost of increasing the offer: the buyer
 must make larger payments if the landowner accepts the offer, which happens
 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The left hand side of (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) is the marginal benefit of increasing the offer, which is the product
 of two quantities: the probability that increasing the offer changes the
 landowner's conservation decision and the expected net gain from changing
 the parcel's choice.
 The latter term is the expected gain conditional on the parcel being indifferen

 Note that if there is no correlation between

\begin_layout Standard
The upper bound on 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

 consistent with the landowner conserving the land until time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is found by considering the landowners' decision at time 0.
 At this time, the landowner must decide whether to develop the land immediately
 and receive a payoff of 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

 in every period or to accept the buyer's offered conservation payment 
\begin_inset Formula $\temp$
\end_inset

 for this period and retain the option to conserve or develop the land at
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The landowner knows 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

, which will give private information about the likelihood of possible values
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\se$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoEP\neq0.$
\end_inset

 In particular, 
\begin_inset Formula $\se|\priv\sim N\left(\sigP\rhoES\rhoEP\left(\priv-\meanP\right),\sigP\sqrt{\cVal}\right).$
\end_inset

 This induces a subjective probability distribution over possible offers
 with density 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\offer|\priv}\left(\offer|\priv\right)=\sum_{\se:\offer^{*}\left(\se,\ubPriv\right)=\offer}f_{\se|\priv}\left(\se|\priv\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The expected benefit of conservation for the landowner is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
B\left(\priv\right)=\temp+\ew\left(\intop_{\priv}^{\infty}\left(\offer-\priv\right)f_{\offer|\priv}\left(\offer|\priv\right)d\offer\right)-\priv.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Consistent with the second period decision, the landowner is assumed to
 conserve the land when indifferent.
 Although there is no closed form solution for 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer^{*}\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

, several conclusions about the landowner's decision can be reached.
 First, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 is bounded below by zero, the landowner will conserve the land if it was
 privately optimal to do so without a policy, e.g.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv\leq0$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula $\priv\leq0$
\end_inset

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer-\priv\geq0$
\end_inset

 for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\offer|\priv}\left(\offer|\priv\right)>0$
\end_inset

.
 This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ew\left(\intop_{\priv}^{\infty}\left(\offer-\priv\right)f_{\offer|\priv}\left(\offer|\priv\right)d\offer\right)\geq0$
\end_inset

 and therefore that 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(\priv\right)\geq0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv\leq0$
\end_inset

, with strict inequality when 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv<0$
\end_inset

.
 As a result, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv\leq0$
\end_inset

, the landowner will conserve in period 1 (since this is privately optimal).
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv=0$
\end_inset

, the landowner will never strictly prefer development and will thus conserve
 since the model assumes indifference is resolved in favor on conservation.
 This implies that all parcels with 
\begin_inset Formula $p\leq0$
\end_inset

 will conserve in the first period or that the possibility of making a positive
 payment for conservation will not induce a landowner that privately prefers
 conservation to develop.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Second, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoEP=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(0\right)=\temp+\ew\left(\intop_{\priv}^{\infty}\left(\offer-\priv\right)f_{\offer|\priv}\left(\offer|\priv\right)d\offer\right)\geq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\offer|\priv}\left(\offer|\priv\right)$
\end_inset

 is constant for all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

, implying that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dB}{d\priv}=-1$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, there is a unique threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv$
\end_inset

 such that the landowner will conserve at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv\leq\ubPriv$
\end_inset

 and will develop immediately otherwise.
 As the correlation grows stronger, the impact of changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 on the integral increases.
 It is possible, although unlikely, that there will be multiple solutions
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(p\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a unique threshold exists, its value solves the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(\ubPriv\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 If the landowner knows that the parcel is at this threshold, 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv=\ubPriv$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\offer|\priv}\left(\offer|\priv\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer>\ubPriv$
\end_inset

 since the landowner knows that the buyer will never make an offer higher
 than this.
 As a result, the landowner's second period payoff will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv$
\end_inset

 with certainty – either because the buyer offers exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv$
\end_inset

 and the landowner accepts or because the buyer offers 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer<\ubPriv$
\end_inset

 and the landowner chooses to develop.
 As a result 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
B\left(\ubPriv\right)=\temp+\ew\ubPriv-\ubPriv\left(1+\ew\right)=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

implying that the threshold value is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv=\temp$
\end_inset

.
 If the private value is below the cutoff the landowner might receive more
 than the private value in the second period, but if 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv=\ubPriv$
\end_inset

, the landowner will only conserve today if the payment today exceeds the
 private development value.
 As a result, while the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

 may affect the landowner payoff if 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv\leq\ubPriv$
\end_inset

, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

 has no impact on the likelihood the parcel will convert or on the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv\left(\temp\right)$
\end_inset

 as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(\priv\right)=0$
\end_inset

 has a unique solution.
 The simulations discussed below confirm that this is true under a wide
 variety of parameter values.

Buyer's initial period offer with unique threshold

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At time 0, the buyer knows better information will arrive at time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and must decide how aggressive to be in inducing conservation today.
 If the buyer makes a large offer today, the parcel is likely to conserve,
 but the buyer risks both paying for non-additional conservation and conserving
 land that provides conservation benefits below the cost.
 On the other hand, if the buyer makes no offer today, any opportunity to
 alter landowner development decisions is lost since all land with 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv>0$
\end_inset

 will be developed immediately.
 The buyer must balance these concerns in deciding how aggressive to be
 with payments today.
 When there is a unique threshold as described in the previous section,
 the buyer knows that the landowner will develop if 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv>\temp$
\end_inset

 and will conserve otherwise, implying that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv=\temp$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the buyer's full payoff is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\payFull\left(\temp\right)=\intop_{-\infty}^{\temp}\left(\mu_{\env|\priv}\left(\priv\right)-\temp\right)f_{\priv}\left(\priv\right)dp+\delta\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\regPay^{*}\left(\se,\temp\right)f_{\se}\left(\se\right)d\se\label{eq:firstPeriodObjFunc}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which can be simplified to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{\priv}\left(\temp\right)\left(\meanE-\temp\right)-\sigma_{\env}\sigP\rhoEP f_{\priv}\left(\temp\right)+\delta\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\regPay^{*}\left(\se,\temp\right)^{*}\left(\se,\temp\right)f_{\se}\left(\se\right)d\se.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The first-order condition for an interior solution is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f_{\priv}\left(\temp\right)\left(\meanE-\temp+\frac{\sigE}{\sigP}\rhoEP\left(\temp-\meanP\right)\right)+\delta\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial\regPay^{*}}{\partial\ubPriv}\left(\se,\temp\right)f_{\se}\left(\se\right)d\se=F_{p}\left(\temp\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This condition mirrors (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:p2FOC"

\end_inset

) in that the marginal cost of increasing the offer is the probability it
 will be accepted.
 The first term of the marginal benefit is the same as in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:p2FOC"

\end_inset

): the expected gain in the initial period conditional on the parcel's decision
 being changed times the probability its choice is changed.
 The new element is the benefit of increasing the probability that the parcel
 will be undeveloped at time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 when the signal is observed.
 By the envelope theorem, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\regPay^{*}}{\partial\ubPriv}\left(\se,\temp\right)=0$
\end_inset

 if the upper bound is not binding in the second period problem and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\regPay^{*}}{\partial\ubPriv}\left(\se,\temp\right)=\drpf\left(\ubPriv,\se\right)>0$
\end_inset

 when the upper bound is binding.
 Therefore, the new term is necessarily non-negative and considering the
 second period will (weakly) lead to an increase in initial offers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of improved future information on the buyer's payoff can be decompose
d into two effects.
 First, there is the direct effect: improved information in the future will
 allow the buyer to target future offers more precisely and will thus increase
 the buyer's second period payoff.
 Second, there is the indirect effect through the impact on 
\begin_inset Formula $\temp$
\end_inset

.
 This is a second order effect that disappears in the comparative statics
 per the envelope theorem, but measures how much responding to the possibility
 of improved information impacts the buyer's payoff.
 The key numerical questions are how much improved information will increase
 optimal first period offers and how valuable adopting these optimal offers
 will be.
 To answer these questions, I turn to numerical methods since the model
 has no analytical solution.

 Moreover, the model applies to a specific subset of programs within this
 category: ones for which the restricted activity is irreversible.
 An example of this type of program has been operating in the Pimampiro
 watershed in Ecaudor since 2000.
 Throughout the paper, I illustrate the concepts in the model by drawing
 connections with the Pimampiro example, drawing on two previous studies
 of the program.
 zz describe the program in Pimampiro, contrasting it with another PES program
 in Peru.
 The program in Peru operated differently, paying farmers to change their
 landuse.
 While the model in this paper could be modified to address a similar situation,
 it is not appropriate for application to a program like this (or to the
 US conservation reserve program) because the irreversibility of development
 plays an important role in the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pimampiro program shares many features with the model developed here.
 In the initial round of the program, landowners were offered a payment

 maintain natural forest cover on the land.

 estimate that the average benefit of development over a 10 year period
 in the region is $24,471/ha compared to a PES payment of $20,424.
 The study highlights the uncertainty present for the buyer of ecosystem
 services.
 Note that in my model, we would not want to say that $24,471 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanP$
\end_inset

 because we believe this to be an overestimate.
 The key question would be whether the designers of the program thought
 it was an overestimate when they started the analysis.

 Can I say anything about differing sigma values? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors argue that the area had very few and relatively homogenous landowner
s – This suggests relatively low values of both types of uncertainty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of my model, 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanE$
\end_inset

 should be the expected value of the ES per ha of land a priori minus any
 benefits the land provided the area once developed and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigE$
\end_inset

 should be the std deviation of the distribution.
 Note that my model includes the possibility that 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

 is negative.
 This does not have to mean that it provides no ecosystem service value
 only that it provides more value to the buyer when developed than it does
 when conserved.
 Based on the accumulated info, it seems like there is very little chance
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

 was actually negative.
 My simulation results which give a 9% chance of this are probably putting
 excessive weight on this possibility relative to Pimampiro.

The PSAH program in Mexico shares many features with the model in this paper,
 although the specific timing does not match as well as with Pimampiro.
 In this program, the government clearly valued considerations other than
 just ecosystem services.
 While the funds were generated by a fee on water users, the government
 likely considered the transfer of funds to poor households a secondary
 objective.
 Capturing this goal within the model would require modifying Eq.

 to the level of ecosystem services particular parcels might offer or to
 specific information about the likelihood of deforestation.
 Apparently an econometric analysis was performed to estimate risk of deforestat

 The right values for my model would be to set 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanP$
\end_inset

 at the estimated opportunity cost of a specific parcel and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigP$
\end_inset

 using the error in the econometric estimation.
 Note however, that we need the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanP$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanE$
\end_inset

.
 It's less clear that there are any decent estimates for 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanE$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear from discussions of the PSAH program like 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 that decisions about program design were made for political reasons as
 much as for economic reasons.
 It is also unclear whether detailed attempts were made to reduce uncertainty
 about the level of ecosystem services provided by individual parcels.

\begin_layout Standard
A thought experiment – suppose that land that is at high risk of development
 is the land that could be used most intensively.
 Intense use creates more damage, thus the difference in benefits between
 conservation and development would be bigger.

 For instance, many of the summaries of PES plans report very little customizati

 parcels.
 One study notes that policy makers did not feel that parcel specific estimates

\begin_layout Standard
As described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:Buyer's-final-period"

\end_inset

, in the final period the buyer will make an offer by equating the marginal
 cost of increasing the offer with the marginal benefit.
 To illustrate this tradeoff, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:baseMBvMC"

\end_inset

 plots the key components of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for a specific example.
 The solid line is the marginal costs, which is simply the CDF of the distributi
on for private development value given the observed signal 
\begin_inset Formula $\se$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The dotted line is the probability that increasing the offer changes the
 parcel's decision (given by 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)$
\end_inset

), while the dashed line is the expected gain from inducing the parcel to
 conserve, given that the parcel's decision is changed by the increase in
 offer.
 In this example,
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoEP=0$
\end_inset

 .
 Since there is no correlation, knowing that the parcel has accepted the
 offer reveals nothing about the expected benefit of conserving the parcel
 and increasing the offer decreases the conditional gain dollar for dollar.
 The dot-dashed line is the product of the dashed and dotted lines and represent
s the marginal benefit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key benefit of additional information in the second period is that it
 allows the buyer to customize the offer based on the improved understanding
 about the conservation value provided by the parcel.
 Separation of the first order condition into its component parts facilitates
 discussion of how the observed signal and the possibility of correlation
 impact the optimal payment.
 Figure

 the lines from Figure

.
 In the middle column, the buyer observes a signal of zero, while the left
 column and right columns illustrate negative and positive signals respectively
 and thus correspond to learning that the parcel is likely to provide more
 or less benefit when conserved than originally expected.
 The solid black lines show the curves when there is no correlation, the
 dashed lines illustrate negative correlation between public conservation
 value and private development value and the dotted lines illustrates positive
 correlation.
 From this figure, we observe several effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, as the observed signal increases, the conditional gain rises because
 we expect the parcel to provide more value.
 Thus each of the lines in the conditional gain panels on the second row
 shift up as we move from a negative to zero to positive signal.

Second, when there is no correlation between conservation and development
 value, the signal reveals no information about development value and thus
 has no impact on the marginal cost or the probability a parcel is marginal.
 In this case, increasing the signal unambiguously increases the optimal
 offer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, when there is correlation, (either negative or positive), the buyer's
 uncertainty about the 
\emph on
private
\emph default
 value is also reduced through observation of the signal 
\begin_inset Formula $\se$
\end_inset

, leading to changes in the probability that increasing the offer will change
 the landowner's choice and to changes in the costs.
 When the buyer observes a signal of 0 in the middle column, the mean of
 the subjective distribution remains unchanged but its variance falls as
 illustrated with the dotted lines.
 In the left and right columns we see that in addition to reducing the variance
 of the conditional distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

, positive and negative correlation will cause its mean to shift if a non-zero
 signal is observed.
 High signals increase the mean with positive correlation and decrease the
 mean with negative correlation, while low signals do the reverse.
 The combined effects can be positive or negative depending on whether the
 optimal offer is above or below the conditional mean private development
 value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fourth, correlation has a substantial impact on the conditional expected
 gain, shown in the second row of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:deltaMBvMC"

\end_inset

.
 As the offer increases, the expected gain on the marginal parcel falls
 due to the increase in payment.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoEP=0$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 the solid lines), this is the only impact of changing the offer, so the
 conditional gain has a slope of -1 with respect to the offer, as with the
 solid lines.
 With correlation, increasing the offer not only increases the cost at the
 marginal parcel, it also influences the expected conservation value of
 the marginal parcel.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoEP<0$
\end_inset

, the negative correlation implies that as we increase the offer, the conditiona
l expected conservation value falls because the highest conservation value
 parcels are the ones most likely to conserve even with a low offer.
 As a result, the slope of the conditional gain will be less than -1 and
 the dashed lines slope down more steeply than the solid lines.
 The effect is amplified as the negative correlation gets stronger.
 With positive correlation, the conditional expected conservation value
 increases as the offer increases, so the slope will increase and can be
 positive if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigE>\sigP$
\end_inset

, especially when the correlation is strong.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fifth, any correlation dampens the impact of the signal on the conditional
 gain, so the dashed and dotted lines shift up and down less as we move
 across the columns than the solid lines do.
 Intuitively, since knowing the parcel was induced to change its choice
 by the change in offer reveals some information about the expected conservation
 value when there is correlation, there is less remaining uncertainty for
 the signal to reveal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, all of the impacts of changing correlation are dampened as the
 signal reveals more information about the environmental benefit.
 This is because a higher quality signal reduces uncertainty and implies
 that the conditional gain cannot vary as much.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combined effect of the changes on the first two rows is shown on the
 marginal benefit curve in the middle row of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:deltaMBvMC"

\end_inset

.
 For both negative and zero correlation, the marginal benefit first rises,
 then falls, and eventually rises again, approaching zero asymptotically.
 This pattern is reversed for positive correlation if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigP<\sigE$
\end_inset

 as is the case in this example.
 The final row illustrates the buyer's payoff function for the different
 cases.
 With the parameters illustrated here and negative or zero correlation,
 there is a single local (and thus global) maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\regPay\left(\offer,s\right)$
\end_inset

, while with positive correlation there are two local maxima of 
\begin_inset Formula $\regPay\left(\offer,\se\right)$
\end_inset

 in the feasible set: one at zero and one with a positive offer.
 This reflects an important cost that positive correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

 imposes on the buyer: the land is likely to be ecologically valuable only
 when it will also require a high payment to induce conservation.
 Unfortunately, making such a high offer will also induce the landowner
 to conserve when the land is not ecologically valuable.
 In this situation, the buyer is better off making no offer than a low offer
 and must carefully assess whether a zero offer or a high offer is preferable.
 In the example here, the positive solution is preferred with the mean or
 high signal, but no offer is preferred with a low signal.
 Moreover, this implies that the optimal offer may change discontinuously
 as problem parameters change, if the change induces a shift from preferring
 a positive offer to preferring a zero offer.

 With zero or positive correlation, the optimal offer increases with the
 signal observed, while with negative correlation, it will tend to increase
 at low signal values when the direct effect on the expected conservation
 value dominates and will tend to decrease at high signal values when the
 high signal suggests a low development value and thus a low offer needed
 to induce conservation.

 These parameters imply that the buyer's best estimate before observing
 the signal is that the parcel provides twice as much conservation value

 a PES offer has a strong chance of being viable.
 The standard deviations imply that the buyer believes there is a roughly

 and that there is a roughly 91% chance that the net benefit of conservation
 to the buyer is positive.

Final period policy

\begin_layout Standard
In the last period, the buyer has a signal of environmental service value
 that allows some degree of targeting of offers based on the expected environmen
tal service value conditional on the signal observed.
 Based on the offer received, a parcel will fall into one of four categories:
 (I) conserved despite a zero offer because it is privately optimal to do
 so (
\begin_inset Formula $\offer=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv\leq0$
\end_inset

), (II) paid for non-additional conservation (
\begin_inset Formula $\offer>0$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv<0$

\begin_inset Formula $0<\priv\leq\offer$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\priv>\offer$
\end_inset

's (2008) sources of inefficiency from PES programs but do not correspond
 exactly except in the case of category II – payments for non-additional
 conservation, which correspond to Engel et.
 al's case D.
 Category IV here includes both situations where the value of conservation
 is less than the cost (
\begin_inset Formula $\priv>\env$
\end_inset

) so the outcome is efficient and situations where 
\begin_inset Formula $\env>\priv$
\end_inset

 but the buyer's best estimates lead to an offer that was too small to induce
 conservation (what Engel et.

 term Case B).
 Moreover, because of the uncertainty, category III may include parcels
 where the value of conservation ends up being less than the cost so the
 buyer would have been better off not inducing conservation (what Engel
 et.
 al.
 term Case C).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As the offer increases, the buyer must weigh the cost of additional losses
 on parcels in category II against increased gains for moving more parcels
 from category IV to category III.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 illustrates the optimal offers and identifies which parcels will fall into
 each category for three different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

 if all parcels remain undeveloped at the start of the second period.
 In each panel, the private development value increases along the vertical
 axis while the signal increases along the horizontal axis.
 The shaded contours in the background indicate the likelihood that the
 parcel is located at that point.
 The solid line corresponding to the shading for the given 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

 value is the optimal second period offer.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES=0$
\end_inset

, the signal provides no useful information and the buyer will make the
 same offer to all parcels regardless of signal because the expected conservatio
n value is the same throughout the figure.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES>0$
\end_inset

, the conditional gain will shift with the signal as illustrated in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:deltaMBvMC"

\end_inset

, resulting in different offers.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

 increases, the minimum signal that need to induce the buyer to make a positive
 offer increases.
 Above this threshold, increasing the signal increases the offer at a decreasing
 rate, with the rate of decrease falling as the signal quality increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parcel will be developed if it is located above the offer line corresponding
 to the given 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

 value, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv>\offer$
\end_inset

 in this region.
 The offer will result in additional conservation if the parcel is located
 above the y-axis and below the solid line.
 If the parcel is below the y-axis, it would have conserved regardless.
 If it is located below the y-axis and to the right of the dashed line correspon
ding to the given 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

 value, it will be paid for non-additional conservation, while if it lies
 to the left of this line, it will conserve despite a zero offer.
 Since all parcels are made a positive offer when 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES=0$
\end_inset

, there is no dashed line corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES=0$
\end_inset

 and all parcels below the y-axis would be paid for non-additional conservation.
 As the minimum signal needed to induce a positive offer increases with
 signal quality moving from lighter to darker lines, the area in which the
 parcel is paid for non-additional conservation shrinks.
 Moreover, since the offer rises more rapidly as the signal quality increases,
 the area in which the offer induces the parcel to provide additional conservati
on also grows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the buyer observed the signal before any development occurred, the conclusion
s of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:baseOptFinal"

\end_inset

 would be straightforward: better information about conservation value would
 allow the buyer to target purchases more effectively.
 By limiting offers to parcels that are likely to provide high conservation
 value, the buyer would limit non-additional payments and increase the expected
 gain on the parcels in category III.
 But this figure readily demonstrates that if the parcel has a high value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

, it will eventually develop in period 2, implying its owner will develop
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 before the signal is observed unless offered an incentive to conserve.
 In fact, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoEP=0$
\end_inset

 in this scenario, we know from Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Landowner's-prior-period"

\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(\priv\right)=0$
\end_inset

 has a unique solution and therefore any parcel in category III would develop
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 unless given an incentive not to.
 The buyer must pay in the first period to have any option to purchase additiona
l conservation in the second period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv$
\end_inset

 falls, category III shrinks because if the parcel is in the upper right
 of this region, it has a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

 value and would have developed at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 As this region shrinks, the buyer will reduce offers made after observing
 high signals, thus reducing the expected offer.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:baseExpOfferbyUB"

\end_inset

 illustrates the impact of changes in the upper bound remaining undeveloped
 on the expected second period offer and the buyer's optimized second period
 payoff for several different signal quality levels.
 The shading of the lines indicates the signal quality with darker lines
 representing better information.
 As expected, lowering the upper bound reduces the mean offer as long as
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES>0$
\end_inset

.
 For most values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv$
\end_inset

, increasing the signal quality 
\emph on
lowers
\emph default
 the expected offer as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:baseOptFinal"

\end_inset

.
 Since the optimal offer is bounded above by 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv$
\end_inset

, the increase in the offer when the signal is high is constrained and the
 probability of making no offer increases as the minimum signal needed to
 induce a positive offer increases.
 These effects combine to lower the expected offer.
 With a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\ubPriv$
\end_inset

, this effect can be reversed because the offer following a high signal
 is less constrained.
 In the second panel, we see that increasing information naturally increases
 the buyer's optimized payoff, with the impact increasing with the quality
 of the signal.
 Moreover, note that increasing the quality of the signal has a much large
 impact on the buyer's payoff when the upper bound is high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Initial period policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first period, the buyer will weigh the cost of paying to make the
 parcel more likely to conserve in period 1 against the gain from it being
 more likely that the parcel will remain undeveloped in the second period,
 allowing the buyer to achieve the higher payoffs illustrated in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In the two period model, a parcel will be in one of five categories: (I)
 conserved in both periods despite a zero offer at time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 because it is privately optimal to do so (
\begin_inset Formula $\offer=0$

\end_inset

 in a manner similar to Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 In each panel, the dashed line is the initial payment offered to all parties,
 which becomes the upper bound for private development value if the parcel
 remains undeveloped at the start of the second period.
 The dot-dashed line is the optimal second period offer.
 If the buyer does not expect improved information as in the top right panel,
 the second period is simply a repeat of the first; in this case, there
 is no chance the parcel will be developed in the second period and no chance
 the parcel will be made a zero offer in the second period so categories
 I and IV are empty.
 The buyer expects half of the uncertainty about 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

 to be resolved in the middle panel and all of the uncertainty to be resolved
 in the bottom panel.
 In these figures, the dashed line marking the initial period offer and
 the dot-dashed line marking the second period offer diverge for low signals.
 As the signal quality improves, two effects occur.
 First, the first period offer increases, decreasing the size of category
 V.
 Second, the buyer will be able to make a more targeted second period offer,
 reducing the probability the parcel is in category II and increasing the
 probability it is in category I.
 This targeting also shift some 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(s,p\right)$
\end_inset

 pairs from category III to category IV.
 category III may thus increase or decrease with more information.

 The height of the stacked bar gives the probability the parcel will be
 conserved in period 1.
 The light purple section at the top of the bar is the probability the parcel
 will conserve in period 1 but then develop in period 2, so the top of the
 dark purple bar gives the probability the parcel will remain conserved
 at the end of the second period.
 The dark orange bars indicate non-additional conservation that is paid
 for in both periods, while the light orange bars indicate non-additional
 conservation that is only paid for in the first period.
 As the figure demonstrates, improving the quality of the signal increases
 the offer made initially and thus increases the probability the parcel
 will conserve initially.
 In the second period, the better information lowers the probability of
 conservation because the buyer targets high conservation value parcels
 only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The middle panel illustrates the buyer's expected gain across both periods
 relative to no policy.
 The height of the stacked bar gives the expected gain from a PES program
 as a function of the quality of the future information, while the shading
 indicates the contribution to this gain from each category (e.g.
 the conditional gain times the probability the parcel will be in that category).
 Since the buyer will lose if the parcel is in categories I, II, and possibly
 IV, the bars for these categories are below the axis (representing losses)
 and the wide purple bars show much of the gain from category III offsets
 these losses and how much remains.
 The final row illustrates the portion of the gains from the middle panel
 that result from customizing the first period offer to the level of information
 expected at time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 As noted in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:intialOfferTheory"

\end_inset

, this second order effect of information measures the value of adjusting
 current policy for the possibility of improved information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this figure, we see that information changes the optimal offers and
 the probability of first period conservation, but does not have a dramatic
 effect.
 The expected gain rises modestly from 0.19 to 0.25 (or roughly 19% to 25%
 of the initial estimated conservation value) as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

 rises from 0 to 1.
 But only a small portion of the gain from this increase comes from customizing
 the first period policy to the level of expected information.
 Even if the buyer expects to learn 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

 perfectly, adjusting policy today will increase the expected gain by only
 1.3% of the expected conservation value.

 illustrates the impact of changing the mean and variance of private development
 value on the offer made today, the probability of conservation today, the
 expected payoff across both periods, and the value of customizing the first
 period offer to the expected improvement in information.
 The dashed lines in the second and third row represent the outcome if the
 buyer adopted no policy, while the different color lines indicate the value
 for various levels of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the mean development value increases along the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-axis in each panel, two effects occur.
 First, it is less likely that the parcel has a negative private development
 value and will conserve without payment.
 This reduction in the probability of paying for non-additional conservation
 will lead the buyer to increase payments as shown on the top row.
 Second, the cost of inducing a given probability of conservation increases
 because the probability of a high private development value increases.
 This leads to a smaller optimal conservation probability as shown on the
 second row.
 Since the probability of conservation falls to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanP$
\end_inset

 increases, the buyer's payoff (which is measured relative to the value
 of development) also falls to zero.
 Changing the variance of private development while holding the mean constant
 as we move from panel to panel similarly has a number of impacts.
 It increases the probability of both very high and very low private development
 values, while decreasing the probability the parcel is close to the mean.
 This increases the probability the parcel will be paid for non-additional
 service and thus lowers the optimal offer.
 For a high standard deviation and low mean, the high probability of paying
 for non-additional services drives optimal payments to zero and the probability
 of conservation and the buyer payoff converge to the no PES value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of improved future information on the outcomes is illustrated

\end_inset

 Looking at the top row, we see that the lines diverge more as information
 improves, implying that improving information leads to progressively larger
 changes in offers as 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanP$
\end_inset

 increases.
 In other words, the buyer should modify today's policy more in response
 to the possibility of improved information when the private development
 value is expected to be high.
 At the same time, the value of the information, both in terms of the probabilit
y that land is conserved and overall payoff first rises and then falls as
 expected private development value increases.
 Ultimately, this implies that buyers should pay the most attention to the
 possibility of improved information when the uncertainty about private
 development value is smaller than the uncertainty about conservation value
 and the expected development value is neither too small or too large.
 When the expected development value is relatively small, the benefit of
 adopting some conservation payment policy is large because the required
 payments are low, but adjusting that policy to account for improved future
 information is less important.
 When the expected development value is relatively high, the buyer is unlikely
 to be able to profitably induce conservation whether or not improved informatio
n arrives in the future.
 The buyer could marginally increase her payoff by making a large offer
 that is still almost certain to be rejected, but the value of doing so
 is small.
 This pattern remains similar as the variance increases, with one notable
 addition.
 In the top right panel, we see that as the quality of the expected information
 improves (moving from lighter to darker lines), the minimum value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanP$
\end_inset

 that induces the buyer to make an offer falls.
 Holding the variance fixed, lowering the mean will increase the probability
 that the landowner finds conservation privately optimal and will thus increase
 the probability that the buyer will end up paying for non-additional conservati
on.
 Information thus plays an important role in determining how large a probability
 of non-additional payments in period 1 the buyer is willing to tolerate
 when making an offer.

.
 Due to the interpretation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

, the zero correlation case covers many of the scenarios often described
 as correlation between development and conservation value.
 If the buyer knows a particular parcel is likely to have both a high value
 to the landowner if developed and a high value to society if conserved,
 this suggests high values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanE$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanP$
\end_inset

 and relatively low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\priv}$
\end_inset

, but does not imply correlation.
 This section considers the possibility of correlation between the deviations
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$
\end_inset

 from their means.
 As described above, this could occur if the parcel of land possesses a
 difficult to verify or observe characteristic that influences both 
\begin_inset Formula $\env$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv$

\end_layout

\end_inset

 All else equal, positive correlation makes the buyer worse off in all cases
 because the parcel is valuable to conserve  precisely when it is also the
 most expensive to induce to conserve.
 Moreover, since the buyer cannot reliably identify when this is the case,
 attempts to induce conservation of valuable land will require high offers
 that will also be accepted when the parcel provides low gains.
 In contrast, negative correlation improves the situation for the buyer.
 The parcel is most likely to provide high conservation value when it is
 also most likely to be conserved without payment or with only a small payment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, information is far more valuable when there is positive
 correlation.
 With positive correlation and current levels of uncertainty about the conservat
ion value, the buyer will make only a very small offer today.
 The probability of non-additionality and the likelihood of paying a parcel
 more than the services it ultimately provides are too high to raise the
 offer further.
 As a result, it is highly likely that if the parcel has high conservation
 value, it will be developed before the buyer learns this.
 If the buyer knows better information will arrive in the future, it makes
 sense to increase the offer so that it is more likely the parcel will remain
 undeveloped long enough to learn its conservation value is high.
 Moreover, comparing the second and third rows demonstrates that roughly
 half the value of improved information comes from customizing the first
 period offer.
 In contrast with negative correlation, a PES program can be very valuable,
 but improved future information has little impact on that value.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The value is relatively low in all cases, but several important patterns
 emerge.
 First, the value tends to increase as correlation increases, at least up
 to a point.
 Once correlation becomes too high, the buyer is quite confident that only
 parcels with very high development value will provide similarly high conservati
on value.
 The cost of inducing these parcels to conserve until information arrives
 is too high for the buyer to find a PES program valuable so the buyer makes
 no offer in the first period.
 This point is reached at a lower level of correlation as the mean development
 value (and thus the expected cost of achieving a given conservation level)
 increases.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanP=0.75$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigP=0.25$
\end_inset

 in the first panel on the third row, the value of information can be as
 high as 0.16 (which represents 16% of the expected conservation value if
 the land were conserved with certainty).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mean development value is low, the probability of non-additionality
 is relatively high, making the cost of increasing offers to induce more
 conservation high.
 Thus, the value of responding to the possibility of information is lower.
 As the mean development value increases, it lowers the probability of making
 non-additional payments.
 This in turn increases the value of information, until the expected cost
 of conservation approaches the expected benefit of conservation.
 Naturally, as uncertainty about development value increases, the costs
 related to asymmetric information increase, eroding the buyer's ability
 to profitably respond to improved information so the value of information
 falls as we move across each row.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, I developed a two-period model to investigate the impact
 of expected improvements in knowledge on optimal PES plans today.
 Ecologists and hydrologists are continually working to improve our understandin
g of the link between land use decisions and hydrological ecosystem services.
 Waiting until such relationships are well understood carries a real risk
 that land will be developed and the associated services lost if buyers
 wait until they are sure of the science before offering conservation incentives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis suggests that optimal first period offers increase substantially
 as the quality of information the buyer expects to receive increases.
 Despite these often substantial changes in the optimal offer, the difference
 between the buyer's expected benefit from the optimal offer and the buyer's
 expected benefit from the optimal no additional information offer is generally
 small.
 Three primary situations that can lead to larger gains were identified.
 First, when the buyer believes that the most valuable land is at the highest
 risk of immediate development (e.g.
 the buyer believes there is some postie correlation between conservation
 and development value), this positive correlation significantly reduces
 the buyer's expected benefits, but amplifies the importance of preserving
 as much land as possible until better information arrives.
 Second, when the buyer has relatively more information about the development
 value than the conservation value, the costs of asymmetric information
 in the first period are reduced and the scope for improved information
 to alter future incentives is increased.
 Finally, when the buyer believes that most land will be developed in the
 absence of a policy, the low risk of non-additionality reduces the costs
 associated with increasing current PES payments to preserve more land and
 increases the gain from customizing offers to the degree of expected future
 information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the results and conclusion presented here, the model can
 provide important insights for developing a multi-period model.
 Solving the two-period model presented here requires solving the final
 period model with many different levels of current information, the amount
 of land remaining undeveloped as determined by the upper bound on private
 development value of land remaining undeveloped, and the correlation between
 the remaining uncertainty in conservation and private development value
 under numerous parameteriziations.
 These results provide insight into how these factors influence the instantaneou
s benefit a buyer would receive in a multi-period dynamic optimization model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model also suggests that landowners are unlikely to conserve their land
 today if the current incentive offered to do so is less than their private
 net benefit from development, even if they expect a buyer of services to
 receive improved information that may lead to higher offers in the future.
 To the extent that landowners' behavior 
\series bold
\emph on
does
\series default
\emph default
 change in response to prospect of better information, the analysis suggests
 this response must be rooted in either a factor not included in the model,
 like landowner uncertainty about future development value, or the existence
 of multiple, disjoint regions of the landowner benefit distribution that
 prefer conservation.
 The analysis in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Landowner's-prior-period"

\end_inset

 suggests the latter case will only occur when several conditions are met.
 First, there must be strong positive correlation between conservation value
 and private development value, implying that landowners have considerable
 private information about the offers they are likely to receive in the
 future.
 Second, the buyer must currently have a large amount of uncertainty about
 conservation value, but must expect to receive much better information
 in the future.
 Finally, the expected benefit of conservation to the buyer must substantially
 exceed the expected cost of inducing the landowner to conserve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model presented here made several strong assumptions and focused on
 parcel level analysis to yield a tractable model.
 There are reasons to believe that landscape scale effects may be critical
 in understanding the benefit of hydrological ecosystem services, so extending
 the model to consider the impact of the total amount of development or
 conservation and possibly its spatial arrangement would be valuable.
 The key logistical challenge to doing so is specifying a tractable and
 realistic specification of the relationship between the random conservation
 and development value across parcels.
 The present model also assumes that both buyers and sellers know the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoES$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoEP$
\end_inset

 throughout the time frame.
 The implications of the model could be different if one or both parties
 was uncertain about these values.

Simplification of buyer's payoff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The buyer's single period payoff as a function of the payment offered is
 given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\regPay\left(\offer,\se\right)=\intop_{-\infty}^{\offer}\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\env-\offer\right)f_{\env|\se,\priv}\left(\env|\se,\priv\right)d\env f_{\priv|\se}\left(\priv|\se\right)dp
\]

\end_inset

The multivariate normal assumption allows us to simplify this expression
 considerably.
 First, note that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu_{\env|\se,\priv}\left(\se,\priv\right)=\frac{\sigma_{\env}\left(\rho_{\env\priv}-\rho_{\env\priv}\rho_{\se\priv}\right)}{\sigma_{\priv}\left(1-\rho_{\se\priv}^{2}\right)}\priv+\meanE+\frac{\sigma_{\env}\left(\rhoES-\rhoEP\rhoSP\right)}{\left(1-\rho_{\se\priv}^{2}\right)}\se-\frac{\sigma_{\env}\left(\rho_{\env\priv}-\rho_{\env\priv}\rho_{\se\priv}\right)}{\sigma_{\priv}\left(1-\rho_{\se\priv}^{2}\right)}\mu_{\priv}
\]

\end_inset

so the inner integral can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\env-\offer\right)f_{\env|\se,\priv}\left(\env|\se,\priv\right)d\env & = & \intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\env f_{\env|\se,\priv}\left(\env|\se,\priv\right)d\env-\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\offer f_{\env|\se,\priv}\left(\env|\se,\priv\right)d\env\\
 & = & \mu_{\env|\se,\priv}\left(\se,\priv\right)-\offer\\
 & = & \frac{\sigma_{\env}\left(\rho_{\env\priv}-\rhoES\rho_{\se\priv}\right)}{\sigma_{\priv}\left(1-\rhoES^{2}\rhoEP^{2}\right)}\priv+\meanE+\frac{\sigma_{\env}\left(\rhoES-\rhoEP\rhoSP\right)}{\left(1-\rhoES^{2}\rhoEP^{2}\right)}\se-\frac{\sigma_{\env}\left(\rho_{\env\priv}-\rho_{\env\priv}\rho_{\se\priv}\right)}{\sigma_{\priv}\left(1-\rhoES^{2}\rhoEP^{2}\right)}\mu_{\priv}-\offer
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

To simplify derivations, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\meanE+\frac{\sigma_{\env}\left(\rhoES-\rhoEP\rhoSP\right)}{\left(1-\rhoES^{2}\rhoEP^{2}\right)}\se-\frac{\sigma_{\env}\left(\rho_{\env\priv}-\rho_{\env\priv}\rho_{\se\priv}\right)}{\sigma_{\priv}\left(1-\rhoES^{2}\rhoEP^{2}\right)}\mu_{\priv}-\offer$
\end_inset

 and let
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{\sigE\left(\bVal\right)}{\sigP\left(\cVal\right)}$
\end_inset

.
 The full first integral is thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\intop_{-\infty}^{\offer}\left(\alpha+\beta p\right)f_{\priv|\se}\left(\priv|\se\right)dp
\]

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)+\beta\intop_{-\infty}^{\offer}pf_{\priv|\se}\left(\priv|\se\right)dp.
\]

\end_inset

The latter integral can also be simplified under the normality assumption
 to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{\priv|\se}^{2}\left(-f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\right)+\mu_{\priv|\se}F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right).
\]

\end_inset

Combining elements, we have the full first integral as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)+\beta\left(\sigma_{\priv|\se}^{2}\left(-f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\right)+\mu_{\priv|\se}F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\alpha+\beta\mu_{\priv|\se}\right)F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)-\beta\sigma_{\priv|\se}^{2}f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right).
\]

\end_inset

 We also know that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu_{\priv|\se}=\mu_{\priv}+\sigma_{\priv}\rho_{\se\priv}\se
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\beta\mu_{\priv|\se} & = & \frac{\sigE\left(\bVal\right)}{\sigP\left(\cVal\right)}\left(\mu_{\priv}+\sigma_{\priv}\rho_{\se\priv}\se\right)\\
 & = & \frac{\sigE\left(\bVal\right)}{\sigP\left(\cVal\right)}\mu_{\priv}+\frac{\rho_{\se\priv}\left(\bVal\right)}{\left(\cVal\right)}\sigma_{\env}\se
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha+\beta\mu_{\priv|\se} & = & \meanE+\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoES\left(1-\rhoEP^{2}\right)}{\left(\cVal\right)}\se-\frac{\sigE\bVal}{\sigP\left(\cVal\right)}\mu_{\priv}-\offer+\frac{\sigE\bVal}{\sigP\left(\cVal\right)}\mu_{\priv}+\frac{\rhoES\rhoEP\bVal}{\left(\cVal\right)}\sigma_{\env}\se\\
 & = & \meanE+\rho_{\env\se}\sigma_{\env}\se-\offer
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Finally, note that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{\priv|\se}^{2}=\sigma_{\priv}^{2}\left(\cVal\right)
\]

\end_inset

so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\beta\sigma_{\priv|\se}^{2} & = & \sigma_{\env}\sigma_{\priv}\bVal.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Putting all these pieces together, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\regPay\left(\offer,\se\right)=-\sigma_{\env}\sigma_{\priv}\bVal f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)+\left(\meanE+\rho_{\env\se}\sigma_{\env}\se-\offer\right)F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)
\]

\begin_inset Formula $\drpf>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpf\leq0$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\drpfFunc=-\sigma_{\env}\sigma_{\priv}\bVal\frac{df_{\priv|\se}}{d\priv}\left(\offer|\se\right)+\left(\meanE+\rho_{\env\se}\sigma_{\env}\se-\offer\right)f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)-F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)
\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\priv|\se\sim N\left(\mu_{\priv}+\sigma_{\priv}\rhoES\rhoEP\se,\sigP^{2}\left(\cVal\right)\right)$
\end_inset

, we know that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{df_{\priv|\se}}{d\priv}\left(\offer|\se\right)=-\frac{\offer-\mu_{\priv}-\sigma_{\priv}\rhoES\rhoEP\se}{\sigP^{2}\left(\cVal\right)}f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right).
\]

\end_inset

giving
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\regPay}{\partial\offer}\left(\offer,\se\right)=f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\left[\left(\gamma\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}-1\right)\offer+\sigE\rhoES\left(1-\gamma\rhoEP^{2}\right)\se+\meanE-\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}\gamma\meanP\right]-F_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\label{eq:appendixFoc}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\frac{1-\rhoES^{2}}{\cVal}$
\end_inset

.
 The second derivative is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ddrpfFunc=f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\left(\gamma\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}-1\right)+\frac{df_{\priv|\se}}{d\priv}\left(\offer|\se\right)\left[\left(\gamma\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}-1\right)\offer+\sigE\rhoES\left(1-\gamma\rhoEP^{2}\right)\se+\meanE-\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}\gamma\meanP\right]-f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right).
\]

\end_inset

Using the same substitution as above, we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{2}\regPay}{\partial\offer^{2}}=f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\left[\left(\gamma\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}-1\right)+\left(\frac{\mu_{\priv}+\sigma_{\priv}\rhoES\rhoEP\se-\offer}{\sigP^{2}\left(\cVal\right)}\right)\left[\left(\gamma\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}-1\right)\offer+\sigE\rhoES\left(1-\gamma\rhoEP^{2}\right)\se+\meanE-\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}\gamma\meanP\right]-1\right].
\]

\end_inset

Letting 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\left(\gamma\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}-1\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\frac{1}{\sigP^{2}\left(\cVal\right)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c=\frac{\mu_{\priv}+\sigma_{\priv}\rhoES\rhoEP\se}{\sigP^{2}\left(\cVal\right)}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d=\sigE\rhoES\left(1-\gamma\rhoEP^{2}\right)\se+\meanE-\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}\gamma\meanP$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{2}\regPay}{\partial\offer^{2}}=f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\left[a+\left(c-b\offer\right)\left(a\offer+d\right)-1\right]
\]

\end_inset

or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{2}\regPay}{\partial\offer^{2}}=f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\left[a+\left(ca\offer+dc-ba\offer^{2}-bd\offer\right)-1\right]
\]

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{2}\regPay}{\partial\offer^{2}}=f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)\left[-ba\offer^{2}+\left(ca-bd\right)\offer+a+dc-1\right].
\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\priv|\se}\left(\offer|\se\right)>0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial^{2}\regPay}{\partial\offer^{2}}\left(\offer,\se\right)=0$
\end_inset

 only when the term in brackets equals 0.
 This expression is quadratic in 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

, implying that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc$
\end_inset

 has at most two zeros.
 If there are multiple interior local maxima of 
\begin_inset Formula $\regPay\left(\offer,\se\right)$
\end_inset

, they must both have 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc\leq0$
\end_inset

 and be separated by an interior minimum where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial^{2}\regPay}{\partial\offer^{2}}\left(\offer,\se\right)\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 This implies that there must be two zeros of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc$
\end_inset

 between the local maxima.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc$
\end_inset

 has at most two zeros, this requires that the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc$
\end_inset

 is the same for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 above the largest value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 that results in a local maximum.
 Since we must have
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc<0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\drpfFunc=0$
\end_inset

 at the largest local maximum, this requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc<0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\drpfFunc=0$
\end_inset

 for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 above the largest value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 that results in a local maximum.
 Moreover, it requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc<0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\drpfFunc>0$
\end_inset

 for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 below the smallest value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 that results in a local maximum.
 Note that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\offer\to\infty}-ba\offer^{2}+\left(ca-bd\right)\offer+a+dc-1=-ba\left(\infty\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b>0$
\end_inset

, suggesting that the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc$
\end_inset

 at very high values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 is the opposite of the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Since we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddrpfFunc<0$
\end_inset

 at high values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

, we can only have two local maxima of 
\begin_inset Formula $\regPay\left(\offer,\se\right)$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\offer\to-\infty}\drpfFunc=\left(1-\gamma\frac{\sigma_{\env}\rhoEP}{\sigma_{\priv}}\right)\infty=-a\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, at very low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

, the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\drpfFunc$
\end_inset

 is opposite the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 So if 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\drpfFunc<0$
\end_inset

 at very low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

, which contradicts the requirement that 
\begin_inset Formula $\drpfFunc>0$
\end_inset

 for values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 below the smallest value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\offer$
\end_inset

 that results in a local maximum.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\rpfFunc$
\end_inset

 has at most one interior local maximum on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-\infty,\infty\right)$
\end_inset

, it has at most one interior local maximum on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\ubPriv\right]$
\end_inset

.

Numerical simulation details

As described in Section zz, neither the first nor the second period buyer
 optimization problems have closed form solutions.
 To explore the implications of the model, I use numerical simulations programme
d in 
\shape smallcaps
Matlab
\shape default
.
 The second period problem is a fairly straightforward maximization problem.
 There is a closed form expression for both the buyer's objective function
 and the first order conditions for an interior maximum.
 To solve this maximization problem efficiently for multiple parameter sets
 simultaneously I use the nonlinear complementarity problem solver ncpsolve
 from the CompEcon 2016 toolbox.

\end_inset

 For most parameter sets, the problem is well behaved and solves quickly
 and easily, but two issues can arise.
 First, as described in Section zz, there is a single local interior maximum
 to the buyer's problem, but the true maximum may occur at one of the endpoints
 and there may be local minima within the interval.
 This can lead the ncpsolve algorithm to get stuck in a region away from
 the solution.
 I use a coarse grid search on possible values to identify good starting
 points for the solver algorithm to avoid this problem.
 Second, for some parameter sets, the buyer's objective function is extremely
 flat.
 These examples represent cases with a very high expected private value
 relative to the expected conservation value.
 The buyer will receive a payoff of 0 by making no offer but can increase
 the payoff a very small amount by making an offer arbitrarily close to
 the conditional expected benefit of conservation.
 The offer is virtually certain to be rejected and hence yields the buyer
 an expected payoff of almost zero.
 When this gain gets too small, the algorithm may fail to identify this
 maximum.
 I supplement the ncpsolve algorithm with checks to identify these cases
 and manually set the optimal offer in these cases.
 For some parameter cases, the ncpsolve algorithm is unable to solve multiple
 problems simultaneously due to large scaling differences between the cases.
 When the algorithm fails in these cases, I revert to solving the individual
 problems case by case using 
\shape smallcaps
Matlab
\shape default
's built-in nonlinear constrained optimization algorithm (fmincon).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the second period problem is relatively straightforward, the first
 period problem is not because the buyer's objective function involves taking
 expectations over possible future signals, recognizing that the second
 period offer will be optimized in response to the observed signal.
 I use the fmincon solver to solve this maximization problem.
 Within the buyer's objective function, I use a vectorized global adapative
 quadrature algorithm (quadvgk available on the Mathworks File Exchange)
 to calculate the integrals that give the expected period 2 payoffs.
 The simulation code is available from the author upon request.

signalImpact This code begins by considering grids of possible period 2
 information and exploring what might happen.
 These results are used in drawing figures for the text but not in computing
 optimal first period offers.
 The code then uses matlab's fmincon to optimize first period offers, calling
 the objective function regPayFullReal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
p2Out calculates expected period 2 outcomes using a grid of values for signal
 draws.
 Can be used to calculate either the expected outcomes conditional a specific
 first period offer or to calculate the expected p2 outcomes assuming the
 regulator optimizes the offer in period2.
 Can also weight by signal probability or consider all points equally likely.
 Accuracy will depend on number of points in the grid.
 Can also be set to simply return the period2 outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
optOfferSimple first uses a grid search to identify a good starting point.
 Then uses the nonlinear complementary problem solver from the CompEcon2016
 toolbox to solve the period 2 maximization problem for each case.
 There are cases for which this algorithm fails to find the true optimum.
 Using the grid search to identify better starting points eliminates most
 of these, but for some parameter values, the objective function is very
 flat and the algorithm gets stuck and believes it has found a solution
 when in fact, it has not.
 These are cases in which the buyer can achieve a positive but extremely
 small payoff by making an offer that is just below the conditional expected
 gain.
 Essentially, it does not matter what the regulator does because the land
 will almost certainly be developed regardless, but the true optimal offer
 is arbitrarily close to the conditional expected gain.
 For these cases, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

optimal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 offer was taken to be the conditional expected gain.
 In other cases, the ncpsolve algorithm fails to converge.
 For these cases, the individual problems are solved case by case using
 matlab's fmincon solver with the trust-region-reflective algorithm.

 replicates the left-hand columns of Figure

 with negative and positive correlation.
 Two effects are apparent from this figure.
 First, in the left hand column, we see that with negative correlation,
 the optimal offer first increases and then decreases as the observed signal
 of conservation value rises.
 At low signal value values, the increase in the expected conservation value
 dominates and leads to higher offers.
 When a high signal is observed, this causes the buyer to believe the developmen
t is likely to be low, suggesting that the parcel can be induced to conserve
 with a lower offer.
 Second, we see that when there is correlation, the signal reveals information
 about the expected development value, so the probability the parcel is
 in each location in the figure changes as the signal increases.
 With negative correlation, the probability of observing high 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 and low

 or low
